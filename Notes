DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH
              This is a colon
              separated list of
              directories that
              contain libraries.  If
              a dylib is not found
              at its install  path,
              dyld uses this as a
              list of directories to
              search for the dylib.

              For new binaries (Fall
              2023 or later) there
              is no default.  For
              older binaries, their
              is a default fallback
              search path of:
              /usr/local/lib:/usr/lib.

- shockwave can be two cylinders (some small width)

WORKS:
if (CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME MATCHES OSX)
    set(RPATH "/usr/local/lib")
    target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} assimp.5)
    target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} ${OPENGL_LIBRARIES} GLEW.2.2 glfw.3)
    target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} "-framework OpenGL")
    target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} fmod)
    set_target_properties(${PROJECT_NAME} PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME "client.exe" LINK_FLAGS "-Wl,-rpath,${RPATH}")


===== May 30 2024 =====
- Test on demo machines
- Need to have TypeID + override for new status effects
- Multi packet
- shockwave attack
- swipe attack in CollisionManager
